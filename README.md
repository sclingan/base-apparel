## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learned a lot about using HTML for validating user input as a 'first pass'. Using Javascript to validate
Emails and form submission. Focusing on learning React and Vite.



### Continued development

Still learning React and Vite, focusing on semantic HTML and using CSS correctly.


### Useful resources

- (https://validator.w3.org/) - Test and validate your HTML!!
- (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - A great resource for everything web dev.
